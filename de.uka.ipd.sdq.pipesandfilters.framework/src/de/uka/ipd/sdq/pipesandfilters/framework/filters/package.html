This package contains all filter implementations. Filters can be prepended to recorders for data manipulation. A filter that receives a measurement tuple descides whether it is thrown away or passed forward to all its successors in the filter chain. By default, a filter may have at most one input but can have an arbitrary number of outputs. These constants can be overriden by concrete filter implementations.
